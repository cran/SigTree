		CHANGES IN SigTree VERSION 1.6

NEW FEATURES

    o N/A
	
BUG FIXES

    o The ape package's which.edge() function was rewritten
	  in ape version 3.1-3 to allow trees not in clade-wise order,
	  and this new version caused SigTree's export.figtree() function
	  to stall.  The export.figtree(), plotSigTree(), and export.inherit()
	  functions of SigTree all now have an added step to reorder
	  the tree in clade-wise order, and rather than call the new
	  which.edge() function inside a loop (as before), 
	  export.figtree() instead accomplishes the same result (as the call
	  to the old which.edge() function) by an efficient call 
	  of the match() function.

BUG FIXES

    o N/A

OTHER CHANGES

    o Cleaned up NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION files
	  (using Imports in DESCRIPTION and multiple import() 
	  in correct order in NAMESPACE to appease CRAN)

    o Updated SigTree.c to copy changes in plot_phylo.c from
	  ape package; also updated .C() calls in plotphylo2 function
	  to reflect these changes.  This was to appease CRAN,
	  as ape changes in R version 3.1.0 had caused problems
	  with SigTree.

	  compatible).

    o Edge-specific coloring (as in FigTree) is now allowed
	  using the "branch='edge'" option in plotSigTree

	  (edge or node specific) added using "branch.label"
	  argument.

	o Root edge addition (and coloring) now allowed by
	  plotSigTree using "root.edge" argument.

	o Branch labels (for either edge or node, as controlled
	  by "branch" argument) made to agree between
	  plotSigTree and export.inherit functions.

BUG FIXES

    o N/A

OTHER CHANGES

    o For 1-sided p-values and a named color palette like 'RdBu',
	  the default mid-range color is now a medium grey for
