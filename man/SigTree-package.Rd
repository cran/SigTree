Determine significantly responsive branches in phylogenetic trees
}
\description{
\code{SigTree} is a package of functions to determine significant response of branches of phylogenetic trees and produce colored plots both in R and (via exported .tre file) FigTree.
\code{\link{plotSigTree}} takes a phylogenetic tree (of class phylo) and a data frame (or matrix) of corresponding tip (OTU) labels and p-values and determines the significance of the branches (as families of p-values) and plots the tree with colored branches (corresponding to families) according to the level of significance of the branch.  \code{\link{export.inherit}} produces a CSV file (or data frame) with the p-values for all branches as well as which tips belong to which branches. \code{\link{export.figtree}} exports a .tre file that can be opened in FigTree that produces a colored plot (with colors according to the significance of corresponding branches) with p-value annotations.
